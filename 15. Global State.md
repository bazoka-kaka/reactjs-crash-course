# Global State

we don't want our tasks in one component, because we wanna be able to access these tasks from another components, so you could use something like the context api, or redux
<br>
here we're just gonna put it into app.js that will make it a global state
then we could pass it down into a components that we want as props

<br>

in Tasks.js:

```
const Tasks = ({ tasks }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <h3 key={task.id}>{task.text}</h3>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};

export default Tasks;
```

in App.js:

```
import Header from "./components/Header";
import React from "react";
import Tasks from "./components/Tasks";
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([
    {
      id: 1,
      text: "Doctors Appointment",
      day: "Feb 5th at 2:30pm",
      reminder: true,
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      text: "Meeting at School",
      day: "Feb 6th at 1:30pm",
      reminder: true,
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      text: "Food Shopping",
      day: "Feb 5th at 2:30pm",
      reminder: false,
    },
  ]);
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <Header />
      <Tasks tasks={tasks} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

in Tasks.js:

```
const Tasks = ({ tasks }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <h3 key={task.id}>{task.text}</h3>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};

export default Tasks;
```
