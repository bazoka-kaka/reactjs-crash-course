# JSON Server

This is gonna allow us to create a mock REST API
with our own data.
using this, you can create a db.json with some data, then you could also do POST, GET,
PATCH, DELETE just like a real backend built using nodejs and express or django, laravel, etc

<br>

installing it:

```
> npm i json-server
```

add in package.json:

```
"scripts": {
  "server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000",
}
```

running the server:

```
> npm run server
```

This is gonna create a file "db.json"

<br>

we also wanna run our react server in another terminal:

```
> npm start
```

<br>
settings in db.json:

```
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "Doctors Appointment",
      "day": "Feb 5th at 2:30pm",
      "reminder": true
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Meeting at School",
      "day": "Feb 6th at 1:30pm",
      "reminder": true
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "text": "Food Shopping",
      "day": "Feb 5th at 2:30pm",
      "reminder": false
    }
  ]
}
```

now you can go here: <br>
http://localhost:5000/tasks
