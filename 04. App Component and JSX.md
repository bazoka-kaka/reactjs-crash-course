# App Component And JSX

The root app component is in src/App.js
<br>
you can't have "class" attribute
in your .jsx/.js file, you could only have
"className", also the "for" attribute,
you could only have "htmlFor"
<br>
to make emmet work on your react .js file,
you have to enable it by:
<br>
on the right bottom side of your vsc, click
on the language then set it to javascript
react
<br>
if you don't wanna have a div or any elements
around after the return is called in your
react .js files, you can leave it empty:
"return <></>"
<br>
Final code in App.js:

```
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>Hello From React</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

note:<br>
in this project, delete 4 useless files in the src directory
