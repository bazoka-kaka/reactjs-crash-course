# Intro and Slides

## What is REACT?

React is a javascript library for building user interfaces
<br>
React runs on the client as SPA (Single Page App),
but can also be used to build a full stack apps
by communicating with a server/API (e.g MERN stack)
<br>
React is often refered to as the "frontend"
because it's capable and directly
comparable to a framework such as Angular or Vue
<br>

#### explanation:

- react is maintained by facebook
- when you have a web app for example run using php,
  you are running php on the server then it serves
  html template or pages to the client
- but with react you build Single App Application
  (SPA) where you have one single HTML page
  then all your routing is done through react
  which then compiles to a javascript bundle
  that's loaded by the browser
- react is often combined with other technologies
  to create a full-stack application
  (mern, mongodb, express \[backend\]
  framework, react, nodejs \[a javascript runtime\],
  you can even use php laravel as the backend or python
  django where you're gonna serve json data on the server
  then you make request from react to the server to get, update,
  and delete data)
- react doesn't have a default routing system
  you have to install it first (reactRouterDOM)
- library is like lodash, jquery, etc (something
  where you pull utilities in then use them in your app)
  but react doesn't work like that, it works more like angular
  or view (which are frameworks)
- if you wanna be a front end or full stack developer,
  you just want to use all the tech out there, test then
  see what you really click with also look for jobs in your area
  what that job uses

## Why Use React?

- structure the "view" layer of your application
- reusable components with their own state
- JSX -- Dynamic markup
- interactive UIs with DOM
- performance and testing
- Very popular in the industry

#### Explanation:

- mvc (model view controller) is a popular design pattern
  for software. the model deals with the data, the controller deals
  with the request and routing, then the view is the ui.
  react is bassically the "v" in mvc.
- if you're only using vanilla javascript, it's gonna be messy
  react allows you to build ui using reusable components
  (every part of your ui is looked up as dynamic components
  that can hold its own states and data)
- we don't have to separate our markups from logics because
  react uses something called jsx (allows us write dynamic html)
  it's bassically javascript but it's formatted in html
  where we can embed javascript codes
- interactive UIs with DOM where you can update parts
  that needs to be updated without reloading it, it does
  everything behind the scenes (not like php where every
  delete requires you refreshing the page)
  which makes react faster, more dynamic and more interactive
- managing data is very easy with data binding, all the data
  in your state is immutable (you can't mutate datas directly)
  but react provides ways to recreate your state everytime
  it needs to be changed

## What you should know first?

have a good handle on javascript
<br>

- data types, variables, functions, etc
- promises, async programming
- array methods like forEach() & map()
- fetch API & making HTTP request (crash courses available)

## Components: Functions vs Classes

React could be build using function and class components.
here, we'll be focusing more on the function components
with hooks which is the more common way to do things these days.

<br>

Function:

```
export const Header = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Header</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Class:

```
export default class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My Header</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Components render/return JSX (Javascript Syntax Extension)
Components can also take in "props"

```
<Header title="My Title" />
```

once you have your component created, you can
embed it into other components
that is similar to XML just like above. you can also
pass in props which are attributes that is whatever you want
then work with it
<br>
The syntax of React looks like html, but actually it's just syntatic sugar
for javascript which is called "Javascript Syntax Extension"
or JSX which is similar to the HTML syntax
aside for some things like the class
attribute, you have to use "className"
but you could also add in the usual javascript there.
<br>

## Working with State

components can also have "state" which is an object
that determines how a component renders and behaves
<br>
"App" or "global" state refers to state that is available
to the entire UI, not just a single component.
<br>
prior to react 16.8, we had to use class based components
to use state. now we can use functional components using hooks.

#### explanation:

- sometimes you end up having a ton of
  app level states that gets really difficult to manage
  so in that case, you have a few options, you can use
  the context api which is built into react.
  or you can use a third party state manager like redux (more videos)
- function components are also called "dumb" components
  because they couldn't hold states, but in react 16.8
  the hooks is created which allows functions to use states
  just like in the class components

## React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that let us hook
into the react state and lifecycle features
from function components.

<br>

- useState --> returns a stateful value
  and function to update it
- useEffect --> perform side effects in function
  components
- useContext, useReducer, useRef -->
  beyond the scope of this resource

#### explanation:

- one of the biggest uses of useEffect is
  to make http requests on the page load

- in the end we're gonna implement something called json
  server which is just like a dummy backend to see how react works
  and when you're doing request to the backend
