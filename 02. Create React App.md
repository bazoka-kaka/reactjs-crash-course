there's lots of ways to start making react app
the most common and easiest ways is using
create-react-app which is a CLI
<br>
create-react-app is gonna make you easily setup react
with all the boilerplates with all the files
and folders and packages that you need, also have a development server
all you need to build up your static assets, to deploy
<br>
you need npm to install this, meaning you have
