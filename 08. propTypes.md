# PropTypes

This is a built-in type system
for your properties. it's not something you have to use
but will help you to make your code more robust

```
Robust programming, also called bomb-proof programming, is a style of programming that prevents abnormal termination or unexpected actions.
```

with your extension (es7 react) you can do this to your Header.js or any file that you wanna import to:

```
impt
```

then press "Enter" to import proptypes.
<br>
in your Header.js:

```
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

const Header = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
    </header>
  );
};

Header.defaultProps = {
  name: "Task Tracker",
};

Header.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string,
};

export default Header;
```

by doing this, if you add your props as other than a string, you're gonna get an error
<br>
you can also use something like
typescript in react also
<br>
you can also add PropTypes.\[datatype\].isRequired
<br>
this is gonna make your code throws an error if the prop is left empty
<br>
in Header.js:

```
Header.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};
```
