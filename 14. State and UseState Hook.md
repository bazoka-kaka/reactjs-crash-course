# State and UseState Hook

we don't want the array in Tasks.js separate from our component, so just use hook usestate

<br>
implementation:
<br>
in Tasks.js:

```
import { useState } from "react";

const Tasks = () => {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([
    {
      id: 1,
      text: "Doctors Appointment",
      day: "Feb 5th at 2:30pm",
      reminder: true,
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      text: "Meeting at School",
      day: "Feb 6th at 1:30pm",
      reminder: true,
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      text: "Food Shopping",
      day: "Feb 5th at 2:30pm",
      reminder: false,
    },
  ]);
  return (
    <>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <h3 key={task.id}>{task.text}</h3>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};

export default Tasks;
```

note:
<br>
you can't do something like
tasks.push() because state is immutable, it's not
something you can directly change
