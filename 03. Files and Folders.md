# Files and Folders

## in package.json

we have these dependencies:
<br>

- react
- react\-dom --> responsible to render
  our react application out to the document object model
  (to the browser), but if you are building react native,
  you would have react native instead of react dom
- react scripts --> comes with the development server,
  the build tool, and so on

<br>
we have the scripts:

- npm start \-\-\> npm start will run the development
  server on localhost:3000
- npm run build \-\-\> build our static assets
  for deployment
- eject \-\-\> if you wanna change something in the webpack config

<br>
running our dev server, in the terminal:

```
> npm start
```
