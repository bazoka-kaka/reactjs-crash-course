# Icons with react-icons

you could install font-awesome instead, but here, we're gonna use the react-icons which is gonna allow you to use multiple icon libraries
<br>
in your terminal:

```
> npm i react-icons
```

This is better than using cdn

<br>

in Task.js:

```
import { FaTimes } from "react-icons/fa";

const Task = ({ task }) => {
  return (
    <div className="task">
      <h3>
        {task.text} <FaTimes style={{ color: "red", cursor: "pointer" }} />
      </h3>
      <p>{task.day}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Task;
```
