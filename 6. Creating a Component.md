# Creating a Component

in the src folder, create a folder called "components" which is the place where you're gonna make all of your components.
<br>
here, create a component called "Header.js"
<br>
recommended extension:<br>
ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
<br>
this have bunch of things like imports, exports, loops, regular javascript things, also it has
snippets for components:
<br>

- rcc \-\-\> Create a class based component
- rce \-\-\> Create a class based component but the exporting happens at the bottom
- rafce \-\-\> Create an arrow function with exporting happens at the bottom

<br>

to do this just type this in your Header.js:

```
rafce
```

then hit "Enter"

<br>

you can get rid of the:

```
import React from 'react';
```

because once it used to be required, but not anymore
<br>
the final Header.js:

```
const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1> Task Tracker</h1>
    </header>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

import Header to your App.js:

```
import Header from './components/Header';
```

The final App.js:
function style:

```
import Header from "./components/Header";
import React from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

class style:

```
import Header from "./components/Header";
//implement this for ... extends React.Component
import React from "react";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="container">
        <Header />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
